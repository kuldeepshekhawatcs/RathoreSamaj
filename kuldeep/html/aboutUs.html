This About Us page for Madebyband takes a bit of a different approach, but still manages to instantly communicate the brand's personality via some hand crafted type and a dispersal of simple accompanying images. The use of handwritten type adds a unique personal touch to the page design, and the clean, simple imagery and presence of white space helps to balance everything out.

So, whether it's through custom type or a few personal images, try to find a way to interject your brand's personality into your About Us page.
